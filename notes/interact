what interact events do I want?


open door/chest

close door

unlock door/chest

pickup item

from spells:

	remote open door/chest
	remote close door
	remote pickup item



when I'm calling interact, how do I know which one I'm calling?
option A:
	caller decides
	requires input differentiation or designing so that inputs are unambiguous
	works well with how events are structured (with events targetting response types)
option B: 
	receiver decides
	requires the receiver to be on one single type
	differentiation must happen in the response function on the receiver


close object:
	close command sent from player
	send interact to object
		payload: no code
	response disambiguates (hopefully) to close
	repsponse performs action
* issue here: same event is used for open and close, so no dedicated "close" command possible
	this might be a benefit, not a problem

bump open:
	bump a solid object
	send interact to object
		payload: no code
	response disambiguates to open
	response performs opening code

pickup item:
	bump walkable object
	send interact to object
		payload: no code
	response disambiguates to pickup
	response gives inventory and self destructs entity

pick pocket:
	bump object
	send thiefskill to object
		payload: pickpocket
	response decorates with arguments
	response calls pickpocket

unlock door/chest
	bump solid object
	object is locked
	send thiefskill to object
		payload: lockpick
	response decorates with arguments
	response calls lockpick
